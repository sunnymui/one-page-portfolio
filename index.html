                        We launched our non profit, Razing the Bar, almost 3 years ago on a self funded budget, with a mission to change the way that under-resourced youth populations are afforded public services. As we had our successes, and the word started to get out about our alternative approach to working with disadvantaged youth, we needed a way to share the information with the public - a website! <br><br>The manager of the non profit where we'd been 'renting' office space connected us to Code for San Jose. I attended a meeting, shared a bit about what we were doing, and a few people volunteered. Within a few days, we had a four person crew working on our site - of which Sunny was one. <br><br>During the course of the site being developed, the team was extremely helpful, worked diligently to get the site done in a timely manner and often made suggestions on how we could improve our site. Our site was built using Wordpress as the CMS. Sunny integrated online donation capabilities, a dynamic contact form, an animated timeline, and implemented custom page templates to achieve the look we wanted. He wrote custom functions, styled pages to look great with CSS, and made sure everything was responsive for visitors using any device. Sunny was a true pleasure to work with, and his knowledge around site development is amazing.<br><br>I highly recommend Sunny for both his individual and collaborative efforts.

                        I worked with Sunny closely for years as we helped build a startup from the ground up. He was involved in both marketing work and, later on, in the design and web development side.<br><br>He's an adaptable guy who wore multiple hats as he took charge of the design of the Globial web app, while also building a coherent design voice for the company with different marketing materials. As we grew as a company, Sunny learned, from scratch, how to implement his designs as he became the primary front end web developer for Globial. He contributed in many ways outside of his daily tasks as our lead UI/UX designer.<br><br>I would love to work with Sunny again and recommend him to anyone considering him as an employee.

                      Make things, draft designs, write code, etc. I'll build an initial version, build it again, and again, and again. We'll iterate and try things while involving you in the feedback loop.
